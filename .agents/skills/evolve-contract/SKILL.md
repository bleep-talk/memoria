description: Change an RMS public contract safely; use for commands, queries, events, APIs, capabilities, schemas, failure semantics, or operational behavior consumed outside a module.

# Evolve a Public Contract

1. Run the `inspect-module` workflow for the owning module.
2. Build a bounded packet with `rms context <module> --task "<task>"` when the CLI is available. Use `rms evolve-contract <module> --task "<task>"` when a compatibility prompt would help.
3. Identify all published contract versions and known consumers.
4. Classify the proposed change:
   - implementation-only;
   - backward-compatible additive;
   - behavioral but compatible;
   - deprecated;
   - breaking shape change;
   - breaking semantic or operational change;
   - stored-state or migration change.
5. Compare not only schema but also:
   - meaning;
   - preconditions and postconditions;
   - failures;
   - authorization;
   - idempotency;
   - ordering;
   - consistency;
   - timeout and retry behavior.
   - artifact version and transformation compatibility;
   - protocol participants, messages, legal ordering, and terminal states;
   - resource ownership or temporal guarantees exposed to consumers;
   - observation schemas, assumption meaning, quantity dimensions, verdicts, and replay artifact shapes for executable properties;
   - privileged, unsafe, or foreign authority assumptions.
6. Preserve the existing version when compatibility can be maintained cleanly.
7. Introduce a new version for breaking changes.
8. Define migration, coexistence, translation, and deprecation behavior.
9. Apply the semantic change before implementation when a provided or required contract changes. Use `contracts.set` with `direction: provided|required` to revise the module's provider surface or consumer expectation without transferring ownership. Direction may be omitted only when one existing direction is unambiguous. Use `contracts.add` for a genuinely new contract and `contracts.remove` only when the selected provider or consumer reference is intentionally removed. Contract entries must state product-specific meaning, accepted inputs, guaranteed outcomes, and explicit rejection categories. Revise the corresponding `public_behavior_bindings` or `dependency_behavior_bindings` in the same semantic change so no old contract-to-code route survives. Public commands, required capabilities, command variants, parser behavior, adapters, entrypoints, effects, effect results, and evidence obligations must be reflected in `module.yaml`, contracts, and `implementation.yaml`; do not change them only in source.
   - Keep binding type names under `architecture.machine.types` and public semantic alternatives in the machine lists.
   - When a changed effect outcome can alter subsequent behavior, add the typed result and follow-up transition to the contract change; do not encode the policy in the executor.
10. Update provider and consumer contract evidence.
11. Run `rms check-compat <old-module> <new-module>`, `rms validate --root <root>`, `rms spec check <module.yaml|implementation.yaml>`, `rms structure <implementation.yaml>` when a binding exists, and relevant scenarios.
12. Record the decision and consumer impact in a concise change note.
