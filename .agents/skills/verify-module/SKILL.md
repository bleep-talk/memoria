# Verify an RMS Module

1. Run `rms check --environment` when starting from an unfamiliar checkout.
2. Read the target manifest and implementation binding.
3. Run `rms validate --root <root>` or validate the explicit target manifests.
4. Run `rms review <module>` when verifying an active diff. Run `rms spec check <module.yaml|implementation.yaml>`, `rms machine check <implementation.yaml>` when an implementation binding exists, and `rms property check <module.yaml|implementation.yaml>` when laws, parsers, numeric bounds, reusable modules, generated input spaces, fuzz targets, or counterexamples are involved. Run `rms verify <implementation.yaml>` when the implementation binding declares `commands.verify`, or `rms verify <composite-module.yaml>` for composite rollups. Then require coverage-aware `rms check --changes --root <root>` to exit zero, run each returned project-owned native proof command, request the candidate commit only when authorized, and require coverage-aware `rms check --committed --root <root>` to exit zero for the committed affected delta. Report candidate regressions, unchanged baseline debt, native paths, outside-coverage gaps, and whether coverage is full or partial. Never describe a native or outside-coverage path as RMS-certified. A failed check is a failure, not a manual note. Run `rms check --all --root <root>` before claiming exhaustive release or CI certification; it retains strict full-repository provenance, composition, proof regeneration, and coverage gates.
   - Production checks require `rms/implementation/v0.2`. Run `rms structure <implementation.yaml>` and require transitive effect analysis to pass. A pure function has no authority and no unresolved call. An effectful function declares exactly its inferred authority row.
   - Use `rms property generate <implementation.yaml> --out <assembly>` to verify deterministic schema-derived inputs for a probe v0.2 machine. Equal digest, seed, generator version, and case count must produce equal output. An unsupported schema result requires a manual generator; it is not a skip.
   - Run `rms compose --root <root>` for read-only closure. When executable composition is part of the claim, dry-run `--output`, write the artifacts, and execute the generated assembly through the declared probe/property lane.
5. Confirm manifest validity and referenced-file existence.
6. Check ownership and dependency boundaries:
   - no undeclared imports or calls;
   - no private-state access;
   - no undeclared effects;
   - no business concepts added to the technical kernel without justification.
   - every implemented public behavior has exactly one valid `public_behavior_bindings` chain;
   - every implemented required capability has exactly one valid `dependency_behavior_bindings` chain;
   - shape-inapplicable stages are reported as `not-applicable`, while missing or unresolved applicable links remain failures.
7. Run declared evidence:
   - laws;
   - contracts;
   - scenarios;
   - boundaries when applicable.
   - semantic properties and fuzz targets with `rms property check`;
   - property/fuzz commands with `rms property run <implementation.yaml> --profile smoke` when the binding declares them;
   - executable trace verdicts, finite witnesses/counterexamples or relationship analyses as applicable, and recorded results with `rms property replay <analysis.yaml>`.
   - local trace bundles with `rms trace check`, `rms trace show`, or `rms trace diagnose` when transition evidence is recorded as JSON or YAML.
   - `rms probe <implementation.yaml> --describe` followed by one described smoke input when the binding is inspectable. Probe failures block verification, but successful probes remain ephemeral diagnostics rather than evidence.
   - generated composition artifacts only after regeneration and digest comparison when canonical evidence references them;
   - proof certificates only when every subject, contract, implementation, source, tool, strategy, assumption, and evidence digest matches. Reject every stale or partial certificate.
   - `rms hunt --root <root> --dry-run` when auditing reliability posture, to report the risk-derived nightly lanes, tools, and unsupported obligations without running the expensive campaign. Run a budgeted hunt only when requested or scheduled.
8. Check domain representation evidence:
   - closed domain alternatives use ADTs, sealed variants, enums, or an equivalent explicit representation;
   - values with validity rules cannot be constructed invalidly except through rejected boundary input;
   - expected domain failures are represented explicitly enough for callers to handle;
   - untrusted or versioned input is validated before domain entry;
   - public read models or result structs without public constructors are declared in `architecture.allowed_missing_constructors` only when they are produced by a named query/projector with evidence;
   - lifecycle/order-dependent behavior has a state model, transition table, or transition function;
   - traceable behavior declares message envelopes, transition output, transition records, replay support, and first-bad-transition evidence where applicable; expected failures remain in a typed transition rejection channel, records match the canonical case's exact outputs, and an applied transition declaration or synthetic copy of it is not replay evidence.
   - machine semantic lists contain actual alternatives while binding container names appear only under `architecture.machine.types`.
   - stateful machines have one state-plus-input transition; every transition input is exactly one command, observed event, or effect result.
   - every transition has a stable semantic case; every declared case occurs in declared transition source, no source-only branch escapes canonical semantics, every lifecycle state is reachable from `initial_state`, and each case appears in replay evidence whose provenance names that source file and branch.
   - every effect declares request/result atomicity, an exact executor symbol, and an effectful `effect-executor` semantic function; every effectful stateful machine declares exact driver and transition-record functions; every effect-emitting runnable surface reaches that driver; the driver retains complete records, advances from `state_after`, executes `output.effects`, and owns the complete repeated cycle; and surfaces, adapters, and executors contain no hidden business sequencing or state progression.
   - every declared message envelope has a binding-native representation, and transition arithmetic over indices, counts, attempts, offsets, lengths, and sequences is checked or bounded with explicit rejection for extreme inputs.
   - broad laws that say always, never, bounded, ordered, normalized, parsed, generated, impossible, or must not happen have semantic properties with input spaces, operations, oracles, evidence, and replayable counterexample policy.
   - boundary, storage, integration, and runnable parser surfaces have fuzz-style semantic targets or a concrete no-fuzz justification; fixed corpora do not satisfy open-ended fuzz claims; every realization resolves an exact runner, and generated or exhaustive strategies resolve a generator that the runner actually calls before the operation and oracle.
   - active trace bundles have smoke producers; each producer calls the declared transition-record function, serializes returned records, and compares cleanly under `rms trace run <implementation.yaml> --profile smoke`.
   - semantic roles, state variants, commands, events, effects, effect results, semantic-function authority bindings, public entrypoints, and evidence roles are declared in canonical artifacts rather than invented by direct source or manifest edits; active non-composition invariants have a matching function owner and active semantic-change records reflect the exact binding.
   - public commands in `module.yaml` are represented by the declared implementation machine, parser, adapter, transition, representation, or semantic functions.
   - runnable app, browser, UI, CLI, HTTP, batch, and executable surfaces are declared and route through declared public entrypoints, parsers, adapters, or boundary machines instead of importing or duplicating pure/private decision roles directly.
   - runnable delegation resolves to an exact callable symbol when inspectable, declares boundary effects or a no-effect justification, references an existing usage document, and resolves a smoke command that `rms verify` executes. Inspectable boundary IO has machine effects, typed results, atomic protocols, and dedicated executor ownership.
   - aggregate control flow is accepted only for the exact protocol that declares aggregate atomicity, justification, and evidence; shared effect-support code remains private and does not construct states or transitions.
   - composite proof delegations resolve parent law, contained provider, provider law/property, public export, and concrete evidence without duplicating child properties in the parent.
   - public domain structs cannot bypass validated construction through `allowed_public_field_structs`; only envelopes and transition/provenance records use that exemption.
   - exhaustive strict audit with `rms check --all` reports `semantic.revision-integrity`; regenerates smoke traces, properties, and reusable packages; and rejects proof commands that mutate production files.
   - reusable modules declare `provides.capabilities[]`, expose one RMS public facade, include package/reuse evidence, and have no consumers importing private representation, transition, parser, adapter, or port internals.
   - generated public contracts have been replaced through `contracts.set` with product-specific meaning, accepted inputs, guaranteed outcomes, and rejection categories.
   - generated `Accept`/`Reject` scaffolds have been replaced or semantically justified when the module publishes product-specific commands.
   - versioned artifact requirements resolve to one compatible provider, and each transformation names declared input/output artifacts, rejection cases, semantic owner, and preserving properties.
   - each public protocol has one owner per participant and one sender/receiver mapping per message; cross-module traces preserve envelope identity, correlation, causation, endpoints, and sequence.
   - every declared resource operation is legal in its resource state and every reachable terminal machine path closes or transfers the resource.
   - privileged, unsafe, and foreign source operations occur only in authority-bound roles behind exact safe facade symbols.
   - temporal claims use typed observations, explicit assumptions, dimensionally valid bounds, and evidence capable of proving their scope; only exhausted finite search may make universal finite claims, while runtime/platform bounds use monitoring, model checking, static analysis, sanitizers, or benchmarks as declared.
9. Check negative cases. Verification should reject or make unrepresentable impossible variants, invalid constructors, malformed boundary input, and illegal state transitions.
10. Check all declared profile obligations:
   - Stateful: transitions, concurrency, persistence, migration;
   - Distributed: idempotency, delivery, retry, timeout, duplicates, effect lifecycle, reconciliation;
   - Workflow: terminal states, deadlines, subscription registry, golden timeline, replay bundle, compensation, resumption;
   - Boundary: validation, trust, limits, compatibility.
11. Check public compatibility against the previous accepted version with `rms check-compat` when manifests changed.
12. Confirm manifests, glossary, contracts, and operational docs remain accurate.
13. For reusable modules, run `rms package <module.yaml>` and confirm it records a concrete pass in the declared package evidence, rebuilds, and verifies the final artifact. Use `rms verify-package <package-dir>` as an independent recheck, then confirm the package contains the module manifest, contracts, implementation binding, declared public facade, recorded evidence, conformance report, source revision, and checksums.
14. Produce an evidence summary with pass, fail, skipped, and not-applicable items. State the proof scope precisely: exhausted finite exploration proves only its declared model; fuzzing, sanitizers, generated cases, bounded search, and mutation testing remain bounded evidence; surviving mutants and weak coverage are proof gaps rather than product bugs. For stateful or workflow behavior, name whether transition records, golden timeline tests, replay bundles, `rms trace` checks, first-bad-transition diagnostics, semantic properties, counterexample replay, hunt posture, affected committed proof, and exhaustive strict audit were checked. Do not report success without identifying the checks actually run, and do not treat implemented modules as complete while `rms validate --root <root>` reports `semantic.contract-scaffold-active`, `evidence.placeholder`, `evidence.bootstrap-active`, `evidence.source-unpinned`, `evidence.semantic-shape-only`, `semantic.reusable-capability-missing`, `semantic.reusable-package-evidence-missing`, `semantic.property-without-input-space`, `semantic.property-without-oracle`, `semantic.property-evidence-missing`, `structure.property-target-missing`, `structure.boundary-parser-without-fuzz-property`, `structure.hunt-lane-missing`, `structure.public-command-not-represented`, `structure.generic-scaffold-command-active`, `structure.native-package-export-mismatch`, or `structure.runnable-surface-*` for those modules. Evidence must not claim a current filesystem snapshot or missing Git revision; the committed affected check records candidate provenance, and `rms check --all` resolves the complete release revision. Never repair canonical artifacts by direct editing; if the CLI cannot express a required repair, report an RMS product gap.
15. Use `rms trace stitch <trace-bundle>... --output <system-trace>` for scenarios crossing modules, then `rms trace diagnose <system-trace>` to identify the first broken handoff.
